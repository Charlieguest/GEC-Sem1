# GEC-Sem1

## All of my work for GEC semester 1:

I've added all my prjects to one solution. Using Github, I added each project with it's accompanying
branch and updated that branch regularly until the projects completion. In this solution are programs
3-39.

To view the code for one of my solutions. Navigate to the solution explorer, click the drop down arrow,
and file the corresponding '.cpp' file and click on that. To view the project output, go back to the parent
folder. Right click and select 'Set as Startup Project'. Then press the Local Windows Debugger play button 
to run the code.
